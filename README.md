This is the very raw form of my jupyter notebook in which I implemented the BBP700 RTQC tests I presented at ADMT21.

There is much to do to make this notebook accessible to everyone.

I will try to slowly write down a TO DO list.

The presentation I gave at the ADMT21 on this topic is here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Kkof40Cj5zWuVHQiRpudBRybXW6hJ4VQ/view?usp=sharing

A group of ADMT people interested in BBP had a post-ADMT meeting to discuss the proposed test further. I've prepared another presentation with notes/decisions taken: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JxdmBCS2MhG6qzmHwpmTCb-D5D3uX3qC/view?usp=sharing

I will do my best to generate a "binder" version of this as soon as I can.

I've tried to use functions as much as possible, so you can already extract the functions with the tests (and the adpative median filter).

Any help in tidying things up is very welcome :-)
