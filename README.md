# Introduction
This repository holds a new set of real-time quality-control (RTQC) test for particulate optical backscattering (BBP) data collected by BGC-Argo floats.

# A bit of history
A draft set of BBP RTQC tests and their impact on the GDAC data were presented at the ADMT21 meeting in 2020: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Kkof40Cj5zWuVHQiRpudBRybXW6hJ4VQ/view?usp=sharing

A group of ADMT people interested in BBP had a post-ADMT21 meeting to discuss the proposed test further. I've prepared another presentation with the feedback/notes/decisions taken: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JxdmBCS2MhG6qzmHwpmTCb-D5D3uX3qC/view?usp=sharing

The current version (30-Sep-2021) of the tests has not been presented to the community yet.
