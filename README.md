This is the very raw form of my jupyter notebook in which I implemented the BBP700 RTQC tests I presented at ADMT21.

There is much to do to make this notebook accessible to everyone.

I will try to slowly write down a TO DO list.

The presentation I gave at the ADMT21 on this topic is here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Kkof40Cj5zWuVHQiRpudBRybXW6hJ4VQ/view?usp=sharing

A group of ADMT people interested in BBP had a post-ADMT meeting to discuss the proposed test further. I've prepared another presentation with notes/decisions taken: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JxdmBCS2MhG6qzmHwpmTCb-D5D3uX3qC/view?usp=sharing
